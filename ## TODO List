## TODO List

- dups step needs maximum_distance=300 when picard is upgraded
- dups needs to run with UMI true so that 'UMI_TAG_NAME=XD' argument is tested, example is false
- add python scripts to PATH so that WDL is cleaner
- hotspot2 process filtered.* and by marked.* is used interchangeably, is this correct?
- what other hotspot2 outputs need to be globbed?
- differential_hotspots is not running now (not implemented), what do we need to run it?
- hotspot2 and spot_score 'mappable' are the same. Will they be different in the future? Will there be one big 'mappable' for all chromosomes
- ftd-learn-dispersion-model in learn_dispersion is not found, installed into docker
- closest_features and motif_matrix is not running, when should it be run?
